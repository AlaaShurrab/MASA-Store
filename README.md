A lot of e-commerce pages are published recently in Gaza especially on Facebook and Instagram, without the existence of a website which make shopping is a tedious work for customer and buyer, we are going to introduce our app to help both customers and sellers. the website will represent who the seller is and what he does and make an impression on his customers and form a competitive advantage within the increasing competition between online shops. It will be much easier for the buyers to have a place to display the list of orders and all the needed details instead of communication on private messages like they do in social media, As will as for customers, it is a better user experience to display the products and all the details with prices and easily make orders.
